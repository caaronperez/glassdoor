Chances are, when you earn a promotion, you've already been doing the work of someone higher up the food chain. If you're angling for a better title -- and the salary that goes with it -- you'll need to first increase your workload and level of expertise at your current job. Approach your supervisor and ask for greater responsibility or offer your assistance on a key initiative."

        information[1]["body"] = "If you are already in charge and have been tasked with developing a defined career path for your employees, get cracking. Human Capital magazine reports that a 2012 Australian study found that two-thirds of finance professionals felt frustrated enough to look for new employment when their employers didn't do enough to define job progression. Long story short? Employees who work hard -- and regularly perform beyond their pay grades -- want official recognition. And the best way to demonstrate that you appreciate their commitment is by developing structured career goals for each title."
        information[2]["title"] = "Applying for a New Job"
        information[2]["body"] = "If you decide to take your career path elsewhere, adapt your resume so it reflects your responsibilities accurately. Chances are you earned additional tasks as you gained experience on the job. Even if your title didn't change, note the progression of tasks clearly so hiring managers can identify your valuable talents. This will demonstrate your importance to your current organization, and it will show that you are capable of learning new tasks and working as a team player."
